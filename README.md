## Tenable Alternatives

Like anyother other industry Tenable also have it’s competitors, and few of them can be considered as good alternatives to Tenable.

I have made a top 5 alternatives to Tenable below.

| Product | Subscription | Price (USD) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Qualys VMDR | 1 year | Starts at ~$5,000 (65 assets) | Pricing varies by asset count and modules; contact for custom quote. |
| Rapid7 InsightVM | 1 year | $19.43–$26.25 per asset | Pricing scales with asset count (e.g., $4,857.50 for 250 assets). |
| Microsoft Defender for Cloud | 1 year | $2–$3 per user/month (add-on) | Standalone or add-on pricing; depends on Microsoft ecosystem integration. |
| Wiz | 1 year | Contact for quote | Custom pricing based on infrastructure size and needs. |
| Intruder | 1 year | Starts at ~$1,500 (Essential) | Offers Essential, Pro, and Premium tiers; 14-day free trial available. |

Tenable excels with its Nessus plugin library (180,000+) and ease of use, but Qualys’s cloud focus or OpenVAS’s free model may suit specific needs.

Test free trials to compare.
